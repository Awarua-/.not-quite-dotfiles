Looks like this:

- ☀️ and ☔️ says whether your git branch is clean or dirty (i.e.has uncommitted code)
- ⇡ and ⇣ says whether you need to push/fetch commits
- `(´ ▽｀).。ｏ♡` says you're badass

## Tiny care bot in your terminal
On every new tab, you can get a motivational tweet from `@tinycarebot`, if
you've got Twitter API keys set up (I do). Once you've set keys up, and
ran the `install` steps in the last section, then you can do:

```
node bin/tinycarebot/run.js
```

## install
Run this:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/notwaldorf/.not-quite-dotfiles.git
cd ~/.not-quite-dotfiles
install
```

## Sooper advanced usage
Add this to your `~\.zshrc` file. I use oh-my-zsh, and all of this works for that.
If you don't, everything might break and this might open the Hellmouth.

```
source $HOME/.not-quite-dotfiles/custom.zsh
```
