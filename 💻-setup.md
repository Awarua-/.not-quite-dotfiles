üíÅ Hello, future Monica. Here's some shit you might need:

## Apps to install

- [ ] [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). Don't forget to disable Spotlight

## Terminal
- [ ] [Mensch](http://robey.lag.net/2010/06/21/mensch-font.html) font
- [ ] Homebrew theme, custom colours. Use the dropper tool because I'm setting this up like it's the 90s.

## Automatic mode (aka "fingers crossed mode")
- [ ] Clone my [dotfiles](https://github.com/notwaldorf/.not-quite.dotfiles)
- [ ] run `setup`
- [ ] maybe open a new tab
- [ ] run `install`
- [ ] definitely open a new tab

## Manual mode (aka "automatic mode didn't work")
### zsh
- [ ] Install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh):
    - This might hose you on new laptops, so make sure you run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`
    - üí£ before you close this functional terminal, open a new tab to make sure you didn't hose it
    - if you did hose it and your shell can't start, there's a `Shell > New Command` option in the menu

### node and ruby and stuff
- [ ] install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
- [ ] `nvm install node`
- [ ] `npm install -g bower && npm install -g polymer-cli`
- [ ] install xcode
- [ ] install the xcode dev tools: `xcode-select --install`
- [ ] `gem install jekyll` or else your blog will never work
- [ ] Clone and run `install` from my  [dotfiles](https://github.com/notwaldorf/.not-quite.dotfiles)

### git
```
git config --global user.name my-name
git config --global user.email my-email
```
